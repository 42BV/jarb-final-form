## 2.1 Back-end

First in your Java project make sure `@42.nl/jarb-final-form` can read
the constraints, via a `GET` request. This is easily done by 
exposing the `BeanConstraintController` like so:

```java
package nl._42.seeder;

import nl._42.jarb.constraint.EnableDatabaseConstraints;

import nl._42.jarb.constraint.metadata.BeanConstraintController;
import nl._42.jarb.constraint.metadata.BeanConstraintService;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDatabaseConstraints(basePackageClasses = Application.class)
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public BeanConstraintController beanConstraintController(BeanConstraintService beanConstraintService) {
        return new BeanConstraintController(beanConstraintService);
    }
}
```

## 2.2 Front-end

At the start of your project, in case you are using Create React
App in the index.js, configure the constraints:

```js
import { configureConstraint } from '@42.nl/jarb-final-form';

configureConstraint({
   // The URL which will provide the constraints over a GET request.
  constraintsUrl: '/api/constraints',

  // Whether or not the 'constraintsUrl' should be called with authentication.
  needsAuthentication: true,
});
```

The constraints module must be configured before the application
is rendered.

Finally you will have load the constraints from the back-end using
the `loadConstraints` function. If in order for the constraints
to be loaded you need to be logged in, you should load the constraints
as soon as you know that you are logged in:

```js
import { loadConstraints } from '@42.nl/jarb-final-form';
import { login } from 'somewhere';

class Login extends Component {
  doLogin(username, password) {
    login({ username, password })
      .then(loadConstraints); // Load constraints ASAP
  }

  render() {
    // Render here which calls doLogin
  }
}
```

If you do not need a login before you can fetch the constraints
simply fetch them using `loadConstraints` as soon as possible.
