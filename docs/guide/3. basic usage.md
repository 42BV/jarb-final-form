If you read the documentation of the [final-form](https://final-form.org/react) libary you will know that you will need the `Field` Component to render form elements. This library simply extends `Field` by adding JaRB validation rules to it. This abstraction is called `JarbField`. JarbField wraps `final-form`'s Field, and adds the auto validation from the JaRB constraints. In fact it is a very thin wrapper around Field. It only demands one extra property called 'jarb' which is used to to configure the Field. The `jarb` object needs two keys: the `validator` and the `label`. 

For example:

```jsx
<JarbField 
  name="Name" 
  jarb={% raw %}{{ validator: 'SuperHero.name', label: "Name" }}{% endraw %}
  component="input" 
  type="text"
/>
```

The `validator` follows the following format: `{Entity}.{Property}`. For example if the validator property is `SuperHero.name` this means that the Field will apply the constraints for the 'name' property of the `SuperHero` entity. The `label` is used to inform you which field was wrong, when errors occur. You will receive the `label` when an error occurs to create a nice error message.
